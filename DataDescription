Data for this study were collected using the up-to-date European Area 
macroeconomic time series of the Area Wide Model (AWM) dataset by Gabriel
Fagan, Jérôme Henry, and Ricardo Mestre. There is a large volume of published 
studies on the European economy using this dataset which consists of a wide 
range of quarterly European Area macroeconomic time series.  We use Gross 
Domestic Product (YER), GDP Deflator (YED) and Nominal short-term interest 
rates (STN) from 1970 Q1 to 2017 Q4. We estimate the models for real GDP 
growth, annualized inflation rate, and nominal interest rates, in a specification 
with two lags in two models. GDP growth is computed as 100 times the log 
difference of real GDP and inflation as 400 times the log difference of the GDP 
deflator. The data is available from 1970 Q2 until 2017 Q4. The first ten years 
(forty observations) are used to specify priors. The first ten years are used as a 
training sample to specify priors then as the actual sample for estimation starting in 1980 Q2.
